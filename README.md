# Radiation-Field-Size-Analysis-Script

ESAPI Single-file plugin script to be run from the 'Portal Imaging' module in Eclipse. After opening an image, run the script to analyse any images within the open patient, which were acquired on the same day (as the selected image). Output is a messagbox to screen, giving the individual collimator sizes for each image.
The script assumes a test object, with radio opaque marker aligned with crosswire, has been used to locate beam centre in image. Field sizes of 4x4, 10x10, 20x20, 8x8 are covered by the script
